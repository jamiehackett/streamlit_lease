1) Refactoring: double check variable names, add comments, write unit tests.
2) Integrate Token Balancer
3) Introduce Chatbot parameters
4) Integrate OpenSource models
5) Cost calculator when OpenAI is used (improving the usage of callbacks)



6) Check out if still exists and update the code to render it more maintainable.
"C:\Users\aCat\anaconda3\envs\aiplayground\lib\site-packages\langchain\llms\openai.py:696: UserWarning: You are trying to use a chat model. This way of initializing it is no longer supported. Instead, please use: `from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI`
  warnings.warn("


7) GPT suggestions:
Bad: Currently, there's no type checking or validation for parameter values when set, which could potentially lead to issues if invalid values are used.
Improvements: I would suggest adding some validation in the set_parameter method to ensure that the value being set is valid for the specified type.


b) Out-of-the-box suggestions:

You could consider implementing a caching mechanism to reduce the computational cost of creating embeddings if the same documents need to be processed repeatedly.
For handling a large number of documents, a batch processing system might be beneficial.
In terms of error handling, consider introducing custom exception classes instead of throwing the generic Exception. This would make debugging easier and your code more robust.
It would be beneficial to add logging throughout your application. This would help in debugging and also in understanding how your application is behaving in production.
For long-running processes, consider implementing a progress monitoring system to give users feedback on the state of the operation.
Consider adding automated tests to ensure your code behaves as expected. This is particularly important when your application goes into production.
